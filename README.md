# LAA Reusable Github Actions

Following the publication of [this article](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/reusing-workflows) by Github
announcing the beta release of reusable workflows, this is an attempt to start a central repository 
of github jobs that can be called from remote repositories.

Examples will be added when I get them working!
